# Chatify
Chatify is a one-on-one chat application. This app is implemented 
using Kotlin. It allows users to create an account or login into their 
existing accounts. Registered users can chat with each other. The 
registered users will be able to see names of all the users who are 
using the app. And they can further start a conversation with anyone 
of them by just a click.
The purpose of this chat application is to keep people connected with each 
other. It keeps the record of the previous chats that youâ€™ve had with other 
users.
